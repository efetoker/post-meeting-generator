# Post-Meeting Social Media Content Generator

It's a web application designed to help financial advisors and other professionals generate social media content automatically from their client meetings.

The application connects to a user's Google Calendar, uses **Recall.ai** to send a notetaker bot to record and transcribe virtual meetings, and then leverages an AI model to generate draft follow-up emails and social media posts based on the meeting's content.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Google Integration**: Securely log in with Google. The app automatically pulls in all upcoming events from the user's connected Google Calendars.
* **Automated Meeting Recording**: Users can toggle a switch for any upcoming meeting to have an AI notetaker (from Recall.ai) automatically join and transcribe the call.
* **AI Content Generation**: After a meeting, the full transcript is used to generate:
    * A draft follow-up email summarizing the discussion.
    * Draft social media posts (LinkedIn, Facebook) based on configurable "Automations".
* **Social Media Posting**: Connect LinkedIn and Facebook accounts via OAuth to post the generated content directly from the app with a single click.
* **Customizable Automations**: Users can configure custom prompts and settings to tailor the tone and style of the generated content for different social media platforms.
* **Meeting History**: A dashboard displays a history of past meetings, giving access to transcripts and all generated content.
